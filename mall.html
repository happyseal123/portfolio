        <h3>Shopping Mall Directory Analysis</h3>

        <h5>Context & Objective</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>As someone who has always loved shopping malls, I jumped at the chance to examine an aspect of shopping malls from a user experience perspective. My goal was to examine one interface in-depth, conducting UX research, crafting personas of archetypal users, and creating a storyboard demonstrating one persona's use of the interface from start to finish.
          </li>
          <li>I turned my attention to <i>digital mall directories:</i></li>
          <img id="mall-direc" src="images/mall-directory.png"/>
          <li>The above sketch highlights the key features of a digital mall directory. This interface aims to improve upon non-digital poster-style mall directories and help users find their way around a mall and discover mall features. A touchscreen makes it possible for users to look at store, office, and dining directories, as well as locate restrooms, see a general map, and find information on current store promotions. The directory also allows users to obtain directions to a specific mall tenant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>UX Research</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Within a shopping center located in metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, I conducted observations of people using the digital mall directory. I also posed the following questions in interviews with people who had just finished using the device:</li>
          <ol id="int-questions">
            <li>What was the reason you began using the mall directory just now?</li>
            <li>Can you show me the steps you took to find what you were looking for?</li>
            <li>How easy or difficult was it to find what you were looking for?</li>
            <li>Did you end up using the directory for any purpose beyond what you originally planned on?</li>
            <li>Are there any features of the directory that you found challenging to use?</li>
            <li>The mall directory you just used is referred to as a digital directory. Have you ever used a non-digital mall directory? (If yes:) Do you have a preference between digital and non-digital mall directories? Why?</li>
            <li>Are there any features you wish the directory had?</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        

        <h5>Persona Development</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Using my observations and interview results, I crafted two personas to represent some archetypal users of digital mall directories.</li>

          <li>One-Stop Samantha is busy with errands today and stopped at the mall to quickly return an item she purchased online, though she considers grabbing coffee quickly if she has time.</li>
          <p>INSERT TABLE</p>
          <p>Samantha is motivated by efficiency and wants to complete her return ASAP, leading to the following interface challenges: using the mall directory to find a single store quickly and then obtaining clear directions to that store, also quickly. Samantha represents an important group of directory users, since many people come to malls with a specific goal and want to complete the goal in the shortest amount of time. Directories must serve these users properly.</p>

          <li>Leisurely Liam came to the mall with friends to have a relaxed day of shopping and eating. Today, he wants to treat himself.</li>
          <p>INSERT TABLE</p>
          <p>Liam wants to go to a few specific stores, but also wants to browse the mall's many shopping and dinding options. His interface challenges include being able to browse all of the mall's options and finding specific types of dining options (ex: sit-down spots for lunch). Liam represents another important group of directory users. It is common for people to come to the mall for leisurely browsing and eating, and directories must serve this class of users properly.</p>

        </ul>
