        <h5 id="context">Context & Objective</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For this project, I turned my attention to <i>digital mall directories, an integral part of the consumer experience at shopping centers</i>. My goal was to examine the interface in-depth by first conducting user experience research and then crafting personas of archetypal users.
          </li>
          <!-- <b>*MAYBE ADD IN STORYBOARD PART LATER*</b> -->
          <img id="mall-direc" src="images/mall-directory.png"/>
          <li>Digital mall directories, sketched above, aim to improve upon non-digital poster-style mall directories to help users better find their way around a shopping center and discover mall features. A touchscreen makes it possible for users to look at mall offerings, locate restrooms, obtain directions to a specific tenant, and find information on current store promotions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 id="research">UX Research</h5>

        <ul>

          <li>
            Within a shopping center located in metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, I conducted <i>observations of people using the digital mall directory</i>, gaining the following insights:</li>
          <ul class="inner-bullets">
            <li>
              Some users explored one item from the right menu (ex: "Stores"), while others browsed through
              several of the menu items (ex: "Stores", "Restaurants", and "Dining")
            </li>
            <li>
              All observed users took a substantial pause and examined the screen after pulling up walking directions
              to their selected destination
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount of time users spent engaging with the directory varied considerably, from less than a minute to over five minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users would tap the directory once and wait for the screen to change, while others would tap repeatedly if the directory did not respond right away
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li>
            To gain a deeper understanding of the digital mall directory user experience, I conducted <i>interview with people who had just finished using the device</i>, asking questions including:
          </li>
          <ul class="inner-bullets">
            <li>What was the reason you began using the mall directory just now?</li>
            <li>Can you show me the steps you took to find what you were looking for?</li>
            <li>How easy or difficult was it to find what you were looking for?</li>
            <li>Did you end up using the directory for any purpose beyond what you originally planned on?</li>
            <li>Are there any features of the directory that you found challenging to use?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Some of the <i>key information I obtained from my interviews</i> is:
          </li>
          <ul class="inner-bullets">
            <li>
              Users engaged with the directory for different reasons, from wanting to find specific stores to locating the nearest restroom to browsing the entire range of shopping and dining options
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users ended up using the directory for a reason other than their original purpose, such as finding a spot to 
              grab coffee when they originally just wanted to find a single store
            </li>
            <li>
              Users generally preferred digital to non-digital directories, but one of the users said they usually just look up the stores of a mall on their phone
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        

        <h5 id="personas">Persona Development</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Using my observations and interview results, I crafted personas to represent two archetypal users of digital mall directories. <i>Personas</i> are fictional individuals that UI/UX designers use to represent typical users of an interface.</li>

          <li><i>One-Stop Samantha</i> is busy with errands today and stopped at the mall to quickly return an item she purchased online, though she considers grabbing coffee quickly if she has time.</li>
          <img class="personas" src="images/samantha.png"/>
          <p class="persona-des">Samantha is motivated by efficiency and wants to complete her return ASAP, leading to the following interface challenges: using the mall directory to find a single store quickly and then obtaining clear directions to that store, also quickly. Samantha represents an important group of directory users, since many people come to malls with a specific goal and want to complete the goal in the shortest amount of time. Directories must serve these users properly.</p>

          <li><i>Leisurely Liam</i> came to the mall with friends to have a relaxed day of shopping and eating. Today, he wants to treat himself.</li>
          <img class="personas" src="images/liam.png"/>
          <p class="persona-des">Liam wants to go to a few specific stores, but also wants to browse the mall's many shopping and dining options. His interface challenges include being able to browse all of the mall's options and finding specific types of dining options (ex: sit-down spots for lunch). Liam represents another important group of directory users. It is common for people to come to the mall for leisurely browsing and eating, and directories must serve this class of users properly.</p>

        </ul>

        <!-- <h5>Storyboarding</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>EXPLAIN WHAT STORYBOARDS ARE</li>
          <li>Considering One-Stop Samantha more in-depth, I crafted a storyboard to show her interaction with the digital mall directory:</li>
          <li>ADD IN STORYBOARD AT END OR GET RID OF STORYBOARD SECTION ENTIRELY</li>

        </ul> -->

        <h5 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Good interview questions are essential for succesful UX research.</i> While conducting interviews of mall directory users, I found that questions targeting a specific aspect of using the directory yielded more information than general questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Keeping personas realistic is important, but not necessarily easy.</i> Personas are used to motivate and inspire the work of UI/UX designers, so keeping them aligned to real users is essential. I had to actively return to my data from observations/interviews to prevent falling into the trap of creating a persona just made up of stereotypes and tropes.
